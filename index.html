        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a creative that enjoys using a variety of mediums to create experiences and solutions for others. I have been playing and creating music for most of my life and as of recent I've taken an interest in film and photography. </p>
        <p>I have an obsession with technology and digital creation, therefore, I hope to strengthen my skills in coding and designing. I hope to one day share my experiences through digital platforms and help others to showcase their businesses and works.  </p>
        <p> At my core I am a designer that enjoys asking questions, finding problems, and solving them. I love to learn and hope that I will be able to create a set of higher quality  projects through the things that I learn with treehouse.  </p>
        <p> And lastly I am a lover of nature and the adventures that it brings. I hope to one day travel around the world and take my profession with me.</p>
